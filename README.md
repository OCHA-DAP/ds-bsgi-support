# Black Sea Grain Initiative Support

## About

Support for the Black Sea Grain Initiative monitoring.

## Reproducing this analysis

Sync the `OCHA BSGI Support Office / 2024 / Reporting and IM / Data` SharePoint
folder to your local machine,
and point to it using an environment variable called
`AA_DATA_DIR`.

Next create a new virtual environment and install the requirements with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, install any code in `src` using the command:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

## Development

All code is formatted according to black and flake8 guidelines.
The repo is set-up to use pre-commit.
Before you start developing in this repository, you will need to run

```shell
pre-commit install
```

The `markdownlint` hook will require
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
to be installed on your computer.

You can run all hooks against all your files using

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

It is also **strongly** recommended to use `jupytext`
to convert all Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) to Markdown files (`.md`)
before committing them into version control. This will make for
cleaner diffs (and thus easier code reviews) and will ensure that cell outputs
aren't
committed to the repo (which might be problematic if working with sensitive
data).
